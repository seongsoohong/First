    <h1>Why am I in this course?</h1>
    <p>I always wanted to build my own webpage.  It is like constructing a building, but for FREE!  and the building I made can be used for my home, business store, play ground, anything! how awesome is that.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Self taught little bit on HTML and CSS, but I needed general gudience to see whole picture of building a webpage.  However when it gets to java script programming or back-end, I have no idea.</p>
